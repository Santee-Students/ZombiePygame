# Zombie Pygame
My attempt at creating a top down zombie shooter game, test driven development style!

### Current features
* State machine implementation (with help from Will McGugan's pygame book)
* Basic laser effects (used demo folder)
* Bullet weapons
* Massive amount of tests. Some tests are missing however, like StateMachine and State class since I just copied from the book.

### Missing features
* Player control
* Proper textures
* Animations

### Demo video

Above is `run.py` There are more in the `demo` folder.

### Requires:
* pygame v1.9.3
* python 3.5
* Pycharm IDE

These are just what I use since I have them on my computer
